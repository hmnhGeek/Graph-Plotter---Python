1.) What is uploading?

Whenever you enter a function to the application,
it first calculates y from given x and stores those 
pairs in a file. So, uploading just rewrites this
file with new data.

2.) Should I take care of domain?

Yes, because the graph will not be created if you
included a point which is not in the domain of function
you entered. For eg: f(x) = (x-5)/(7-x), must not include x = 7.
If included f(x) ---> infinity which cannot be plotted.
